                            done over the years

                    <!-- Add as many paragraphs as you need. -->
                    <p>As part of the team of Sundered Realms, I was tasked with creating the GUI and mechanics of the
                        games
                        skill tree.
                        Through this skil tree you would be able to buy skills that help upgrade your combat and
                        movement in
                        game for advantages against the enemies.
                        I was also tasked with not just creating the skills for the players but creating the skill tree
                        and
                        logic needed to buy these skills.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Spending countless hours on creating the skill tree enhanced the players experience. In charge
                        with this task is ultimately big
                        as I would be affecting the way players interact with the game. So along with changing the
                        combat system I was also an unofficial game tester.
                        Making sure the game run smoothly and find any bugs that was within the game.

                            <p>Currently studying Computer Science at CSUN. I want to be able to apply all these new
                                skills into
                                game
                                development.
                                For my senior design project I along with 4 other teammates made a Roblox game called
                                Sundered
                                Realms.
                                My experience
                                with sundered realms lead me to dive deep more into game development and is something I
                                would
                                want
