                    <p>As part of the team of Sundered Realms, I was tasked with creating the GUI and mechanics of the
                        games
                        skill tree.
                        Through this skil tree you would be able to buy skills that help upgrade your combat and
                        movement in
                        game for advantages against the enemies.
                        I was also tasked with not just creating the skills for the players but creating the skill tree
                        and
                        logic needed to buy these skills.

                    <p>Currently studying Computer Science at CSUN. I want to be able to apply all these new skills into
                        game
                        development.
                        For my senior design project I along with 4 other teammates made a Roblox game called Sundered
                        Realms.
                        My experience
                        with sundered realms lead me to dive deep more into game development and is something I would
                        want
                        to
                        continue after college.
